# Kamao Wireless Split Keyboard

## Features
- uses Seeeduino XIAO BLE 
- split wireless via bluetooth
- 32 keys
- low-profile using choc v1 
- reversible pcb

## Why did I build this?

This was an experiment of sorts for me. I had found that I really liked the Sweep, but wanted a wireless version.
I also wanted to see if I could assemble the board in such a way that the MCU's were both right-side up using software 
to make it work (I couldn"t find a reversible footprint for the Xiao BLE).

## Building

Kicad files are in the kamao folder; I also provided the gerber files so you can just zip them up and upload to your
preferred pcb manufacturer.
